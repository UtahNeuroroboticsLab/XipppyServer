							Error 346. Makes second beep like it connects and starts to do calibration printouts, but hand doesn't move.
							Tried again and can't get error... Maybe recorded for the wrong hand?

							No errors (checked twice)
							Restarted service without setting wlan0 or CAN down. 
								Got RTNETLINK answers: Device or resource bus. 
								Hand opens, then does calibration okay without error.

							Error 245. Won't power down. 
							Try #2: Restarted service manually. No errors, but atypical behavior. Hand opens, then does calibration. 
							Try #3: Didn't restart service. Error 36. 
							Try #4: Restart service. From service: RTNETLINK answers: Device or resource busy. 
								Shutting down CAN and wlan0 then letting them be started by the service seems to work. 
								Powered hand off and on and reconnected okay
								Powered hand off and on again and reconnected okay

							Try #2: put CAN and wlan0 down, stop service, start service
								No errors. Maybe we need to reset CAN if hand disconnects???
