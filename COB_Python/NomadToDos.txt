Nomad To-dos:

System: 
	(nice-to-have) During training, save raw 1k data? Or full time. Should have plenty of HD space

	(if no prod. XippPy) Get BUTTONS from Elliot's code
		Hand starts with StopHand = 1
		Button would enable movement
	
	General code cleanup

	Send message back to GUI after chan sel and kalman training complete	
	

Motor:
	Need to make THE training sequence
		Add some zeros at beginning for hand to get to rest

	(nice-to-have) Temporal alignment of kinematics to emg before training kalman	

Sensory:
	2-second stim

Troy GUI:
	When you move to stim tab - call "get stim params" to update stim table

################### Executive Decisions ##########################################
NO ability to select previous decode. Retrain or use the last trained decode.

DEKA:
	(if needed) Make CAN comm for PNILabview - mimic what hand is doing.

(if needed) Implement velocity toggle on wrist

######################## Completed (date) #########################################
Test both LUKE Arms (prior to 3/29/21)
	Left hand flawless
	Right hand flawless

EMG on  port D, ability to use 3 USEAs (A-C ports) (prior to 3/29/21)

Try running experimenter GUI remotely.. with another wireless card connected to tablet (prior to 3/19/21)

Make GUI connect to Nomad wifi if not connected (prior to 3/19/21)

Save which DOFs are mirror/lock to file and load on boot (3/5/21)

Initial handshake when GUI connects - send back parameters that need to be updated on GUI (3/5/21)
	LED on GUI that shows when hand is connected??
	Migrate to App Designer - make experimenter and user tab



Saving stim params realtime: frequency, amplitude, electrode, NIPTime (2/9/21)
	Saving to .eyn

Get XipppyServer running as a linux service on boot (1/25)
	Close XipppyServer properly on power down https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/48973/execute-a-command-before-shutdown

Disable bad channels?!?!?! Only from lab/research gui (1/18)

**Some function generation (to-dos in XipppyServer) ~267 (1/12)

**Tying DOFs together (GUI: some dropdown) (1/12)
		Open XipppyClientGUI to see what we set up.
		Basically, each digit has a number corresponding to which digit it should be tied to. Leave as 0 if shouldn't be tied to anything.

Test WTS for all 6 DOF (1/12)

Set up UI for sensory (1/12)

Give user ability to set lower and upper amplitude limits - calibration is done on hand itself (1/12)
	Let user set lower and upper amplitude. Frequency is biofidelic

Lock DOF and set position (1/4/20)
	Velocity mode DOFs always switch to Position

Set nomad time from GUI every time they connect. (12/16)

Need eventparams file (12/16)

Save stim params when received from GUI (12/15?)
	Load on startup (12/15?)
	Send stim params to GUI on button press (12/15?)

Set stim params through GUI (12/15?)
	Probably just have a list of active/inactive channels
	Stim: handling multiple sensors mapped to one channel, and vice versa

Save and reload decode (Kalman Matrices, including channel selection) (12/15)

Find out which aspect of stim_engine is taking the most processing.(12/15) (Deep Copy was the culprit)

Toggle for stopping hand motion while GUI is connected? (12/16) SS['stop_hand'] lines 218-223 or search if SS['stop_hand']

Test .eyn file loading 


#################### Discard pile #################################################
??Send channel selection to GUI when complete

Toggle for stim: user ?must? turn it on every time XipppyServer starts

?? Add user ability to stim on selected channel at selected freq/amplitude for ~2s
	Decision: user presses hand to do so
