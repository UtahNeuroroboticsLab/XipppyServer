# Making file system read/writable:
sudo mount -o remount,rw /
	
# For new nomads:
Modify /etc/fstab 
	Take out ro for read only on system drive
	Add line to read from hard drive

	lsmod
	
# Services for linux - starting nipexec/deka server
	/etc/systemd/system - location of most ripple custom services
	Useful commands:
		sudo systemctl start service_name.service - starts a service
		systemctl daemon-reload - reloads services after making changes
		systemctl status service_name.service - check status and logs of service
			e.g., print statements in a service that runs python3
	Future reference:
		Ensure service is calling the correct python! 
			# which python3 - find which python python3 runs on. 

#list directory sizes
