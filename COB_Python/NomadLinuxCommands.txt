# Services for linux - starting nipexec/deka server
	/etc/systemd/system - location of most ripple custom services
	Useful commands:
		sudo systemctl start service_name.service - starts a service
		systemctl daemon-reload - reloads services after making changes
		systemctl status service_name.service - check status and logs of service
			e.g., print statements in a service that runs python3
	Future reference:
		Ensure service is calling the correct python! 
			# which python3 - find which python python3 runs on.

# connecting to wifi - interfaces file, in /etc/network

#Steps
1) Make sure you are connected to wifi
2) ifdown eth0
3) make changes below to /etc/network/interfaces file
4) ifup eth0

# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
# uncomment this when you want to connect to the wired network
# remember to have wifi running or you're hosed
#allow-hotplug eth0
#iface eth0 inet dhcp

## comment this when above is uncommented to connect to internet
